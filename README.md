# PSU

Linear power supply. Consists of two boards - one for transformer, and the other for filtering. One of these filter boards is supposed to distribute power to a single row in the case (voltage regulators should be able to handle 1.5A of current per rail).

Status: finished, tested the changes from the previous version, and everything should be working, but waiting for pcb to confirm that.
